No JSX - use '.ts'

Will the file contain a React component, or any kind of JSX? - use '.tsx'

// Typescript will complain if don't use this rule


// Passing props

Two big checks by Typescript:

1. Are we providing the correct props to Child when we show it in Parent?

2. Are we using the correctly named + typed props in Child?
